    description: The sponsors of this website believe there are many projects arising out of mostly developing countries around the world that can accomplish the dual objective of assisting in the making of disciples as stated in Matt 28:19-20 and simultaneously significantly improve the lives of the people from which the project comes. Currently, most of these projects are not being funded because people and other organizations who have the funds are not aware of the projects and the people with the projects do not know how to find the necessary funding. This website presents a neutral “marketplace’ where these projects can be exposed to the funding sources.
